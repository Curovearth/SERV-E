    <p>With the current boom of technology where the whole world is running towards digitisation and automation, each and every age group of the society is trying to move forward with the current pace. This leads to one of the major problems in one particular age group of our society i.e., the <b>so called ‘Frail’ elderly people</b>. 
<br>As stated by Pennsylvania Home Care, there are 4 major challenges faced by elderly people in their homes        
    <ul>
        <li>Loneliness or Lack of Companionship</li>
        <li>Tripping or Falling in an Unsafe Environment</li>
        <li>Inability to Complete their errands</li>
        <li>Remembering their Medication</li>
   </ul>
The false notion of elderly people unable to handle themselves with the current technology is something 
that lacks addressing in the society where they aren’t being aware about the things which might reduce their 
problems up till some extent.</p>
