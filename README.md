    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <img align=right width=350 src="https://post.healthline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Elderly_Wheelchair_Rearview_732x549-thumbnail-732x549.jpg">
    <p>With the current boom of technology where the whole world is running towards digitisation and automation, each and every age group of the society is trying to move forward with the current pace. This leads to one of the major problems in one particular age group of our society i.e., the <b>so called ‘Frail’ elderly people</b>. 
<br>As stated by Pennsylvania Home Care, there are 4 major challenges faced by elderly people in their homes        
    <ul>
        <li>Loneliness or Lack of Companionship</li>
        <li>Tripping or Falling in an Unsafe Environment</li>
        <li>Inability to Complete their errands</li>
        <li>Remembering their Medication</li>
   </ul>
The false notion of elderly people unable to handle themselves with the current technology is something 
that lacks addressing in the society where they aren’t being aware about the things which might reduce their 
problems up till some extent.</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <img width=400  align=right src="https://github.com/Swarzinium-369/SERV-E/blob/main/Img-Vid/Bot/Bot_med%201.jpeg">
    <p>Our solution majorly focuses on tackling the challenge of excessive movement when one is advised for bedrest with minimal movement. SERV-E plays it's role in bringing their desired items to them with the help of a non holonomic robot arm having 4 degrees of freedom.<br><br>In the current stage we have used a bluetooth sensor via which the user can control the movement of robotic arm and along with is present an ultrasonic sensor to avoid any obstacles within the range of 50 cm.</p>

    <h2>Future Scope</h2>
    <p>I initially aimed to cover a lot of aspects but due to the time and resource constraint, the project was left uncompleted. Following I have highlighted what all can be done to make it much better than the first 
        <ol>
            <li>The current version is a single layer robot but there could be multi levels to have different compartments for putting up the desired objects for the user. </li>
            <li>Because the current version still works via Bluetooth, I want it to have fully enable IoT services to monitor everything such that the control could also be accessed by user’s relatives living at different location. </li>
            <li> The future could see inculcation of neural networks to make the robot much more autonomous in terms of mapping the house and specifying important locations along with the ability to speak to the user as well. </li>
        <ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Problems Faced</h2>
    <p>I created to assign the control of each servo to the user. The prior goal was to fix the broken pipe error which I was facing because of the app created using MIT App inventor but I wasn’t able to figure out for the same.
